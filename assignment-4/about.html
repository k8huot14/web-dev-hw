      <pre>
    Twenty One Pilots (stylized in all lowercase or as twenty øne piløts)
    is an American musical duo from Columbus, Ohio. The band was formed in
    2009 by lead vocalist Tyler Joseph along with Nick Thomas and Chris Salih,
    both of whom left in 2011. Since their departure, the line-up has consisted
    of Joseph and drummer Josh Dun. The duo is best known for the singles "Stressed
    Out", "Ride", and "Heathens". The group received a Grammy Award for Best Pop
    Duo/Group Performance at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards. They accepted their
    Grammy in their underwear. See story attached to photo below.

    The band independently released two albums, Twenty One Pilots (2009) and
    Regional at Best (2011), before being signed by record label Fueled by Ramen
    in 2012. Their label debut, Vessel, was released in 2013. The duo achieved
    breakthrough success with their fourth album, Blurryface (2015), which produced
    the successful singles "Stressed Out" and "Ride" and became the first album in
    history on which every track received at least a gold certification from the
    Recording Industry Association of America. The release of the single "Heathens"
    also made the group the first alternative artist to have two concurrent top ten
    singles in the United States. The duo's fifth studio album, Trench, was released
    on October 5, 2018.
