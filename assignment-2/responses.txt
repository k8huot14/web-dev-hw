1. Briefly describe one way how data travels on the internet.

    Data is broken down into bits and bites using binary code.
    One's and Zeros. 1 = On. 0 = Off.
    It is then digitally transmitted via light or electricity
    through physical wires and cables.
    The data is then sorted into "packets" and sent through
    routers (aka packet switches) which use a specific set of
    instructions to re-construct the packets in order on the
    receiving end. This process is referred as TCP/IP or
    Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol.

2. What is the relationship between an IP address and the DNS?

    The IP address is the unique address in the form of a number
    that is assigned to each computer and server to identify it on
    a network. A DNS is a domain name system that associates the
    domain name or URL with the corresponding IP address number.
    Both HTTP & DNS manage the sending and receiving of web files.

3. What is a cookie?

    A cookie is a bit of information that websites use to
    remember who you are. It is basically an ID card to help your

4. List the three basic parts of a URL.

    A URL is a uniform resource locator which is the name of the
    web page address. There are two types of URLs a relative and
    an absolute address. The directions to a web address consists
    of the protocol, domain, path and file. The protocol is the
    first part of the URL that determines how the web browser will
    communicate with a web server. Ex: HTTP
    The next part is the subdomain and the domain. Ex: www.ex.com
    The third and final part of a URL is the end of the path which
    is often a file, page or even query.
