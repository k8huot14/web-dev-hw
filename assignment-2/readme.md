Describe what a Version Control System is and why we are using one in this class.

    A Version Control System allows the developer/user to make changes to a file and track those changes over time. The developer can also fix mistakes by restoring a previous version. Version control also makes collaboration and sharing easy.

My [Responses](./responses.txt)

Summarize the work you did this cycle.
Problems or Issues? How did you solve them?

    I am getting back into the swing of things and finding my
    work flow again. Updating older files and making corrections
    on responses, taking new screenshots.
